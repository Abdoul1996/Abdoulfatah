## 💡 About Me

I'm a computer scientist and graduate researcher at [CodeLab](https://pleunipennings.wordpress.com/) at San Francisco State University, where I focus on applying machine learning to real-world biomedical problems.

I'm deeply passionate about the intersection of computer science and biology, and I’m particularly excited about working in the biotech industry—where I can contribute to innovative research, tools, and solutions that improve lives. 

As an immigrant and first-generation researcher, I’ve overcome challenges while balancing part-time work and academics. With support from private and federal training fellowships, I’ve built a strong foundation in computational thinking and research. I’m committed to collaboration, mentorship, and using AI to drive impact in health and life sciences.
